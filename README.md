# BharatChain - Decentralized Governance & Citizen Record System 🇮🇳

A blockchain and AI-powered platform to revolutionize how Indian citizens and government interact with official documents, transactions, and services. Designed to enhance transparency, fight corruption, and empower data ownership through decentralization.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

BharatChain is an open-source, decentralized platform aimed at storing, managing, and verifying citizen and government records using blockchain and artificial intelligence. It leverages tamper-proof distributed ledgers and smart contracts to eliminate corruption, increase accountability, and improve public access to essential documents and services.
